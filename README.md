</p>

## Summary
The idea behind our project is to create a forum-style platform that allows users to post blogs within a feed in the form of written words with the option to add media and/or images.

The chatroom element comes into play when adding the comments feature to posts where users can interact with each other regarding various topics of interest or themes.

Users can post to their blog and also view posts from other creators.

Users can also like each otherâ€™s posts; each post can be liked once and the likes increment as more people like it.

One relevant example of a platform that has developed a similar concept is Substack.
